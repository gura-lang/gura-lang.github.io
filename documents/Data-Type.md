A value of nil type is used to indicate an invalid result or status.
It is often used as a returned value of a function when it fails its expected work.
A variable `nil` has a value of nil type.

### Boolean Type

Boolean values are used to determine whether something is in a true or a false state.
Variables named `true` and `false` are assigned with a true value and a false value respectively.

`false` and `nil` are determined as a false state while other values are treated as a true state.
Note that a zero value is recognized as a true, not a false.
