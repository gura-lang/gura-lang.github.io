Flow Control
------------

Like other programming languages, Gura also provides flow-control mechanism that you've already been familiar with.
For instance, conditional branch can be described like below.

    if (x < 0) {
        println('x is less than zero')
    } elsif (x > 0) {
        println('x is greater than zero')
    } else {
        println('x is equal to zero')
    }



- `for`
- `repeat`
- `while`
- `if` - `elsif` - `else`
